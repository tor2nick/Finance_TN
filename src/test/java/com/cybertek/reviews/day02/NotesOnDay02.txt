What do we do as terters?
- actual vs expected
expected comes from : AC, requirements, documentation
actual: from the Browser we test
For Selenium to interact with the page:
1. Locate WebElement
2. Apply the action (sendKeys, click)

To locate one single WebElelement Selenium uses;
finElement method:
***** Single element (findElement"s" for multiple elements)
--accepts as parameter "Locators"
-- return type of this method: WebElement
-- coming from Selenium Library

findElement(by.id,name,class,xpath....)

#1. id:
unique attribute, "dynamic"
#2. name:
check if it is duplicate or not
#3. tagName:  multiple of them
#4. classname, is good to use findElemnts method to find all the elements of a class
#5-#6: LinkText or PartialLinkTExt: anchor Tag, to find links in the page
What happens with these 6 locators when there is multiple (more than one of them in the page)?
***It will find the first one
**It will do action (sendKeys, click) to the first element

P.I.Q.: Can you tell me what is the exception that you encountered the most in testing with Selenium?
-NoSuchElementException
When do you get that exception?
#1. Your locator is not correct.
#2. Started with correct locator, developer changed something
#3. WebElement is not loaded to the page yet, we need to stop the execution of Selenium methods until the
page is loaded  (right now Thread.sleep)  Dynamic wait methods.
